# CS125-Final-Project
Recipe Generator Application created using Android Studio and the Food2Fork API by Dylan Irlbeck and Pranav Narahari 
This was a final project for my CS 125: Introduction to Computer Science course at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. 
Pranav and I used the Food2Fork API to create a simple Android application that takes in ingredients and generates 
recipe information tailored to the user request.
